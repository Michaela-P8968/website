<div id="about-me" class="section level2">
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I grew up in the small town of Stonewall, Texas working on my family’s peach farm with my parents and younger brother. After high school, I moved to Austin to attend college, and I am currently studying Biology and Psychology. Ultimately, my goal is to attend medical school to become a general, family physician. In my spare time, I love volunteering with several different organizations around the Austin community including the Ride On Center for Kids, Dell Children’s Hospital, and Foundation Communities. Some of my favorite hobbies include reading, going to state parks to explore nature, watching musicals, and cooking/baking!</p>
