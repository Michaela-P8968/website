      <description>Python in Genetics Prior to my participation in this class, I had never before worked with Python. While it was (and honestly still is) intimidating at first, I have slowly been getting more comfortable working with Python. I can now definitely see how proficiency in Python is a useful tool to have in computational biology/bioinformatics. Since my degree in biology specifically focuses on genetics and genomics, it was particularly interesting to me when we used regular expressions in python to find endonuclease target sites within a sequence of DNA.</description>
