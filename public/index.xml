      <description>Python in Genetics Prior to my participation in this class, I had never before worked with Python. While it was (and honestly still is) intimidating at first, I have slowly been getting more comfortable working with Python. I can now definitely see how proficiency in Python is a useful tool to have in computational biology/bioinformatics. Since my degree in biology specifically focuses on genetics and genomics, it was particularly interesting to me when we used regular expressions in python to find endonuclease target sites within a sequence of DNA.</description>

      <description>Introduction The datasets that I chose for this project were a dataset on global life expectancy, a dataset on global health expenditure per capita, and a dataset on each country’s region and income group. The global life expectancy dataset was obtained from GitHub (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). This dataset contained information regarding the life expectancy in years for countries throughout the globe. The variables in the dataset were Entity, Code, Year, and Life Expectancy (Years).</description>

      <description>About Me I grew up in the small town of Stonewall, Texas working on my family’s peach farm with my parents and younger brother. After high school, I moved to Austin to attend college, and I am currently studying Biology and Psychology. Ultimately, my goal is to attend medical school to become a general, family physician. In my spare time, I love volunteering with several different organizations around the Austin community including the Ride On Center for Kids, Dell Children’s Hospital, and Foundation Communities.</description>
